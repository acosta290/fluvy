/**
 * A node's live power in both directions, in watts, from the house's point of view: `in` flows toward the house
 * (import, production, discharge), `out` away from it (export, charge). Both can be non-zero at once — a grid read
 * per phase or with two sensors — and that is the point: a net figure hides one of them.
 *
 * `null` = configured but not readable (a dead sensor, a unit that is not power): a sum that quietly skipped a dead
 * phase would be a wrong number, and a wrong number is worse than "—". With two sensors, a dead one blanks only its
 * own direction.
