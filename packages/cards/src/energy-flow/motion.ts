/**
 * The pulses of a flow diagram. Every pulse is a comet carried along its lane by the Web Animations API — transform
 * and opacity only, the lane sampled once — so the compositor runs them without the main thread:
 *
 * - The pace is constant in px/s, 24 → 72 px/s as the flow's share of the house's peak (`max_power`): a long lane is
 *   not faster than a short one, and a trickle crawls.
 * - One to three pulses a lane by its power, one more per 140 px of lane, and never more than eight on a card: every
 *   flowing lane gets its first pulse (the strongest first), then the extras go to the strongest. `calm` keeps one
 *   pulse a lane at a slower pace; `off` and reduced motion keep none.
 * - A lane's pulses are masked by the lane itself (its trimmed path, stroked at its width): a comet's tail never shows
 *   before the lane starts, past its head, or off its curve.
 * - A reading that changes only the power retunes the pace (`updatePlaybackRate`, which keeps each pulse where it is);
 *   a lane that changes its way, its colour or its count fades its pulses out and the new ones in.
 * - Off screen (IntersectionObserver) or in a hidden tab, every pulse is paused.
