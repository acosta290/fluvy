/**
 * The automatic dashboard and the appliance cards read a house by the words people name things with, in every
 * language Fluvy ships at once (a house is named in its own language, not the UI's). This writes those words, from
 * every language's naming words (`packages/core/src/i18n/words/<code>.json`: build input, never shipped), as the
 * regular expressions two modules export:
 *
 *   - `packages/cards/src/strategy/words.generated.ts`: the strategy's rules (lights, solar, the grid, …), in its chunk;
 *   - `packages/cards/src/appliance/words.generated.ts`: an appliance's kind by its name (the `appliance_*` words), in
 *     the appliances' chunk.
 *
 *   pnpm i18n build       (also part of `pnpm build`); the language tools' tests fail when either file is stale
 *
 * A stem is matched as a substring; a stem may carry regex of its own (a boundary: `pv\b`, `mode$`; a lookaround:
 * `(?<!ガス)レンジ`). `light` matches whole words between separators, `generic` matches the whole name, `place_noise`
 * whole words — for a stem in Latin letters. A stem in kana or kanji is matched as a substring whatever its category's
 * shape (Japanese writes no spaces between words): its alternation follows the word-shaped one. The appliance words
 * are plain lower-case letters, matched against a name with its accents taken off and its width made ordinary
 * ("Kühlschrank" is read as "kuhlschrank", as Home Assistant writes it into an entity's id; "ＬＥＤ" as "led"); a
 * kana's voicing mark stays (が is not か).
 *
 * Every regex captures the stem it found as the first group that takes part in the match — the alternation of its
 * stems, never the separator a word shape consumes around them (a stem's own groups are numbered after it). Where
 * classes of words compete for one name (a light's against the appliances', the kinds' against each other), the
 * matcher (`packages/cards/src/shared/words.ts`) reads that group: of two words that overlap in the name the longer
 * wins, whatever the lists' order (電気ケトル is a kettle, not the light 電気; ガスレンジ a hob, not the microwave レンジ),
 * so a stem needs no lookaround against a longer word another list carries. Inside one list the order is the build's:
 * a stem is tried after every longer stem that begins with it (温度計 before 温度, "frigorifero" before "frigo"), so
 * stems that nest need no care in the words; a stem of its own regex keeps its place.
