# Energy

Fluvy's energy cards read a house the way its meters do and say only what they measure. This page is the guide:
how a card finds its sources, how to describe the ones it cannot find, and what each card of the family shows. Every
option of every card is in [the cards](cards.md).

## Where the cards read the house from

**The Energy dashboard, when a card is given nothing.** A flow, a balance, a grid, a batteries card with no
sources of their own read Home Assistant's energy preferences — every grid connection, every array and battery,
with the power sensor you gave each one there (`Settings → Dashboards → Energy`, the power sensors of 2025.12 and
later). A grid or a battery set up there with two power sensors (one for what comes in, one for what goes out) is
read as two sensors — Home Assistant's own diagram nets them into one; Fluvy keeps both, so a house that imports and
exports at the same moment shows both flows.

**Your own sources, when you describe them.** A card's `sources` list replaces the Energy dashboard's. A source is
one of `solar`, `grid`, `battery`, `generator` or `vehicle` (a car that can power the house), read in one of three
ways:

```yaml
sources:
  - type: solar
    power: sensor.inverter_power          # one sensor, positive toward the house
  - type: grid
    import: sensor.grid_import_power      # two sensors, both positive
    export: sensor.grid_export_power
  - type: battery
    power: sensor.battery_power           # + discharging; invert: true for a meter signed the other way
    level: sensor.battery_soc
    capacity: 10                          # kWh: weights several batteries' charge, and says "full in"
```

`power` is one signed sensor: positive is energy toward the house (import, production, discharge). A meter that
counts the other way takes `invert: true`. `import` and `export` are two sensors, both positive. `phases` is a list
of signed sensors, one per phase (or per inverter, per string), summed **per sign** — see below.

Each source may also have a `name`, an `icon`, a `color` (any Home Assistant colour, or `#rrggbb`), `threshold` (the
watts under which it rests, 10 by default), `arrows: none` and `show: active | never` (never: counted, not drawn).

## A house that imports and exports at once

A three-phase house with its solar on one phase can import on two phases while it exports on the third. A single net
meter shows the difference and hides both flows — and then every share worked out from it is wrong (the sun seems to
cover more of the house than it does). Read the grid per phase:

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-energy-flow-card
sources:
  - type: solar
    power: sensor.inverter_power
  - type: grid
    phases:
      - sensor.grid_power_l1
      - sensor.grid_power_l2
      - sensor.grid_power_l3
  - type: battery
    power: sensor.battery_power
    level: sensor.battery_soc
```

Each phase sensor must say its own direction (positive importing, negative exporting — or all inverted together with
`invert: true`). The positive phases are summed as what comes in, the negative ones as what goes out; the grid then
draws two lanes, the import in the grid's colour and the export in the colour of where it came from. If a phase
cannot be read, the grid says "—": a sum that skipped a dead phase would be a wrong number. The Grid card shows each
phase on its own bar, and the balance lists them under "Per phase".

## Live, or a period

A flow, a balance, the sankey and the score can show a day, a week or a month (`period: day`), with Day · Week ·
Month chips to switch. A period reads the Energy dashboard's meters from Home Assistant's long-term statistics, hour
by hour (a day by day over a week or a month), and allocates each hour the way the Energy dashboard does — grid energy
the house did not use went to the battery first, then the sun charged the battery, then it was exported, then the
battery exported, then the rest ran the house — and adds the hours up. The figures are the dashboard's own.

## The cards

- **Energy flow** — where the energy comes from and where it goes. Variants `rows` (sources left, the house right),
  `cross` (the sun above, the grid left, the house right, the battery below, with the flows between sources) and
  `list`; styles `stream` (lanes with pulses of light), `legs` (thin dashed lanes) and `rail` (one quiet track);
  `motion: full | calm | off`; `consumers` (where it goes: the house's biggest loads, and the rest of the house);
  the badge says how much of the house runs on sun (`badge: solar`), its self-sufficiency (`self_powered`), or the
  grid's way (`grid`).
- **Energy balance** — what comes in against what goes out, live or over a period, always adding up (the house is
  what is left); the grid's phases under it; over a period, what it cost and what the feed-in paid.
- **Grid** — the net import or export, what comes in and goes out, each phase with its voltage, the price now, and
  today's import, export and cost.
- **Batteries** — one state of charge for several batteries (weighted by capacity, so give each its `capacity`),
  full in / empty in while they all go the same way, the reserve, each battery on its own row, and the mode, when
  there is a select for it.
- **Car charger** — the car's charge against its target and the time it should be ready, the session's energy and
  time, how much came from the sun, the charging mode; a car that powers the house says so.
- **Where it went (sankey)** — a period from where to where, in true proportions: the grid, the battery and the sun
  into the house, the battery and the export, and the house into its devices and what is not measured.
- **Energy score** — self-powered, the sun used and low-carbon, as the Energy dashboard's own gauges compute them.
- **Water & gas** — each meter's use today against a typical day, what flows right now, and a leak sensor or a valve
  beside them.
- **Energy** — `variant: sources` draws the house's power today by where it came from, stacked, with what went to the
  grid below the line.
- **Energy devices** — rows can nest (`parent`), and a `total` meter shows what is not measured, at every level.
- **Production** — `arrays` stacks each array's hourly bars.
- **Gauge** — `variant: signed` for a meter that can be negative: zero at the top, "1.8 kW out".

## Honest by design

A figure that cannot be read is "—", never a 0; a source that stops reporting is drawn as a dashed hairline and the
head says since when; readings older than ten minutes make the whole diagram rest and say how old they are; the house
is never guessed from a sum that is missing a part.

## Performance

The pulses are Web Animations of `transform` and `opacity` only, sampled once per lane: the compositor runs them
without the main thread. At most eight travel on a card, and all of them pause when the card is off screen or the tab
is hidden. The energy cards arrive as their own file, fetched as Fluvy starts: a dashboard without energy on it never
waits for them.
