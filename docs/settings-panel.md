# The settings panel

**Fluvy** in the sidebar, at `/fluvy`: six tabs, in one row. What belongs to the house is an administrator's to change;
everyone else reads it, and changes their own (a palette of their own, their preferences, this device).

| Tab | What it holds | Whose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Appearance** | palette (fifteen presets, the house's saved palettes, the community's, or a custom accent — shared as a file), shape (soft, round, crisp), button style, the dashboards' tabs (Fluvy, pills, original or hidden; names, icons or both; the dashboard's name), the sidebar and header (Home Assistant's logo, dividers, the header on the page); the lights, where a card says nothing, and the status colours (see below); a live preview on real cards (its little house answers a tap itself: nothing at home changes) | the house; a person may keep their own palette and shape |
| **Charts** | the style every chart is drawn in and the gauge every gauge reads in, each a tile the chart engine draws; what the style lets the house tune; motion; the series colours (the palette's six, or a set of the house's own, made and checked here); a preview of a chart, its bars and a gauge in both modes side by side — see [Charts](#charts) | the house |
| **Scope** | dashboards only or everywhere; which dashboards when "only"; the frame, the icons, the Activity page, the History page | the house |
| **Dashboards** | the five automatic dashboards: create any with one tap, open it, its options, its sidebar entry, recreate it | the house |
| **Wall** | what this device is (a wall panel, its address to open on the tablet), which dashboards are walls, the screensaver (with a preview of it), the way out (a × in the corner, or a long press), the way back from a subview (a button with its name, or Home Assistant's header), day and night, the background; the preview shows the wall as it would be now, in its night when it is night — see [wall mode](wall.md) | the house; *this device* is the tablet's own |
| **Preferences** | language of the cards (a dropdown: *Automatic* follows Home Assistant, or one of Fluvy's), motion, haptics, a link to improving a translation; *This device · Size*: how large this screen reads its dashboards (90 to 150 %, the view alone — see [wall mode](wall.md)); *Fluvy*: the version, the shell's health, export and import of the settings, the house's reset | each person; *this device* is the screen's own; import and reset are an administrator's |

## House and person

The **house settings** are what an administrator sets: everyone sees them. The **personal settings** are each person's,
on every device they sign in on: a palette, a shape and tabs of their own, or the house's; language; motion; haptics.
The look a person sees is the house's, with their own choices on top. A **device setting** belongs to one browser
alone — whether it is a wall panel, and the size it reads at — and never follows a person.

## Lights

Two of the house's settings (1.9) decide what a card of lights does where its own config says nothing. Both are off
until chosen, so a dashboard looks as it did:

| Setting | Values | What a card takes from it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Show their colour** | Never · When on · Always | a light card's `tint`: its light's colour on its whole surface, while the light is on, or at rest too |
| **In their bulb's colour** | off · on | `light_colors` on tiles, a tiles group, a room's tiles and rows, an entities card's rows: a lit bulb in its colour, a white in its warmth |

A change shows on every card of the page at once, before it is saved; a card that sets the key keeps its own. The
room lights card keeps its own default (its lights in their colours), and the automatic dashboards write neither.
How a white shows in its bulb's colour is each card's own (`light_whites`, 1.10): by its warmth, from a candle's to a
neutral daylight and a cool white, unless the card asks for the palette's lit light (`palette`); there is no house
setting for it.

## Status colours

Four of the house's settings (1.9) colour what a card says about the state of things, over every palette — a person's
own palette too:

| Status | What wears it |
| --- | --- |
| **Warning** | what wants a look: an open door or window, a low battery, a reminder due (an appliance's "Clean", "Refill"), an alert of severity warning, the warning tone a card or an item may be given |
| **Danger** | what is wrong now: a leak, smoke, a critical alert, the danger tone |
| **Success** | what is fine: an appliance ready, an eco programme, someone at home (the dot on their picture) |
| **Notice** | information: an alert of severity info |

Each is **Auto** — the palette's own, as before 1.9, so nothing changes on upgrade — or **Custom**: one of six colours
round the wheel (the orange is issue #47's), or any colour typed as a hex or picked from the system's picker. Fluvy
keeps the hue you picked and moves only its lightness — and the chroma the screen cannot show there — as far as it must
to read: the words in it at 4.5:1 on the card and the page, its icon at 3:1 on its circle, the words on its fill and
the fill's hairline as every status's. In light mode an orange like `#dc630b` (3.5:1 on white) becomes `#b04c00`
(5.4:1); in dark it is itself. From it come the status's whole family in both modes — its words, its icon, its fill,
the fill's edge and the ink on it — on every card and sheet, and in Home Assistant's own status colours
(`--warning-color`, `--error-color`, `--success-color` and their scales). Home Assistant's colour *names* (`orange`,
`red`, `green`) stay the palette's: a card asked for orange is still orange.

Where a picked colour sits too close to another status (warning, danger, success and notice stand 5.5 apart, CIEDE2000,
fill from fill and words from words, in light and in dark), Fluvy first takes more of its colour into its fill and
its words a step deeper; where that is not enough, the panel says so under it ("Close to Danger") and changes nothing
else — a hue is never turned aside. The settings are an administrator's (read-only for everyone else), shown on the
panel and the page at once, and saved from the bar ("Status colours · Warning · #dc630b").

## Charts

The house's chart settings (1.11, `charts` and `chartSets` in the house's data) decide how every chart and gauge is
drawn where a card's config says nothing — the sensor's chart and tile, and each chart card as it takes the styles;
the automatic dashboards and the History page write no chart key, so they follow the house too. From the factory the
style is **Classic**, the chart every card drew before 1.11: nothing changes on upgrade.

| Setting | Values (the factory's first) | What it draws |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Style** | Classic · Soft · Glow · Minimal · Steps · Bars · Columns · Band | a card's `chart` where it names none; a style a card cannot draw (bars over several sensors, a band without one) is drawn Classic |
| **Gauge** | Ticks · Dial · Ring · Ruler · Liquid · Sky · Tank · Battery · Pulse · Air · Sun | a gauge's `gauge`: the dial's ticks, the thermostat's dial read, a ring lit to the value with Fluvy's knob at its end, the ruler read — every knob the thermostat's ball — or a gauge that moves with what it reads, drawn where a card's sensor is of its kind (a percentage, a temperature, water stored, a battery, power, wind, the sun's power) and the card's ticks elsewhere; each tile on a reading of its kind |
| **Line** | Regular · Thin · Bold | a style's line (2.5, 1.5 or 3 px); a card's `line_width` wins |
| **Soft shadow** | 5 px · 3 · 7 under the line, 35 % · 25 · 45 | the soft copy of the line in Soft and Glow |
| **Fill** | 18 % · 12 · 24 | the gradient under a line at its top (a flat fill two thirds of it); dark mode six points more |
| **Gridlines** | Hairline · Dashed · None | the hairlines a style draws |
| **Line's end** | Knob · Dot | Fluvy's knob (the thermostat's ball) or the classic dot where a style marks the end |
| **Now** | Knob · Line | where the past meets the forecast: the knob on the line over a hairline, or the hairline alone |
| **Bars' ends** | Both · Top | a bar rounded at both ends, or only away from its axis |
| **Bubble** | Dark · In the series' colour | the value's bubble over a chart |
| **Series colours** | From the palette · a saved set | the six colours of a chart's several series: the palette's (`--fluvy-graph-1…6`) or a set of six of the house's own, its hues kept and each mode wearing it fitted to its card as the palette's are built (two still closer than ΔE 8 are said) |
| **Waves** | Medium · Low · High | how tall a moving gauge's waves stand (4, 7 or 10 px); offered once a gauge that moves is chosen |
| **Motion** | On · Off | whether a chart draws itself in; a card's `animate` wins, and the system's reduced motion always holds |

Classic takes none of these but motion. The rule is one, everywhere: a card's own key wins over the house's setting,
which wins over the style's own default.

### The Charts tab

The tab chooses them as the Appearance tab chooses the look, and every change is shown at once — on the tab's own
drawings and on every card of the page that names no style — and saved from the bar with the rest ("Charts · Style ·
Soft"); Discard puts the saved ones back.

- **Style** and **Gauges**: a tile each (two a row on a phone, four on a wide panel), the engine drawing the style on
  a day of temperature with its forecast (the bars styles on a day of energy) and the gauge on 62 %, in the fine
  settings chosen; the chosen one in the accent's fill with its check.
- **Details**: the fine settings the chosen style draws with, a row of chips each — no other is offered (the engine's
  `HOUSE_ACTS`). Classic takes none, and says so; then **Motion**, which every chart has.

  | Style | Line | Soft shadow | Fill | Gridlines | Line's end | Now | Bars' ends | Bubble |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | Classic | | | | | | | | |
  | Soft | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | Glow | ✓ | ✓ | | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | Minimal | ✓ | | | | | | ✓ | ✓ |
  | Steps | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
  | Bars, Columns | | | | ✓ | | | ✓ | ✓ |
  | Band | ✓ | | | ✓ | | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

  A style's bars' ends count wherever a card of slots (the history bars) draws it; the bubble is every style's while a
  chart is read.
- **Series colours**: the palette's six (its swatches as the look being chosen derives them, in the mode on screen),
  then the house's own sets, each pictured as the mode on screen wears it; a tap wears one. **New set…** opens six
  colour fields on the palette's six — each typed as a hex or picked from the system's picker. A set keeps its six
  hues as chosen, and each mode wears it fitted to its card as the palette's own six are built: a colour that does not
  read at 3:1 there is lifted (dark) or deepened (light) only as far as it takes, at its hue, and a little further where
  that sets it 8 apart (ΔE2000) from the ones before it; a colour that reads is worn as picked. So a navy is lifted on
  the dark card and a cream deepened on the light one, and only what fitting cannot fix is said: two colours still
  closer than 8 ("#2563eb and #2463ea are too close to tell apart"), or brought together on one card ("… on a light
  card"). The two cards show the six lines side by side, as each wears them. **Save set** keeps it with the house at
  once (up to twelve, as its palettes) and wears it, an edit for the bar; **Edit this set** renames or recolours the
  one worn in its place, and **Delete this set** lets it go — charts that wore it wear the palette's again.
- **Preview**: a sensor's day with its bubble, the day's energy as bars and the house's gauge, drawn in the settings
  being chosen, in the light mode and the dark one side by side (under the cards, or in the side column on a wide
  screen). With motion off, every drawing is its resting frame.

Someone who is not an administrator sees the house's choices and the preview, and changes nothing.

## Where they are stored

In Home Assistant's own frontend data, not in a file of Fluvy's: the house under `frontend/set_system_data`
(key `fluvy`, writable by administrators), the person under `frontend/set_user_data` (key `fluvy`). Every browser
subscribes to both, so a palette changed on the desktop recolours the phone at once. What is stored is parsed and
never trusted: a value that does not make sense falls back to its default. A copy of the last applied look is kept in
the browser (`localStorage`, `fluvy:look`) only so that the page paints in the right colours before Home Assistant
answers.

**Backups.** Because both live in Home Assistant's frontend data, a Home Assistant backup keeps every setting of
Fluvy's and a restore brings them back: the look and the saved palettes, the statuses' colours, the lights' defaults,
the wall, the Charts tab (the style, the gauge, every detail, motion) and the house's own series colours. The panel's
*Preferences › Fluvy › Export* writes the same to a file — the house, the person and the options of every automatic
dashboard — and *Import* (an administrator's) reads it back on another house; a file from an earlier version brings
what it holds and leaves the rest at its defaults. What a screen keeps for itself (*This device · Size*, a device's
wall) stays in that browser and travels with neither. A card's own choices (its `chart`, its colours) are part of the
dashboard's configuration, which Home Assistant's backups keep as well.

## "Everywhere" and the theme

Home Assistant's own pages take Fluvy's design only while the theme Home Assistant wears for that person is **Fluvy**
— their profile's theme, or the house's default. With another theme, every Home Assistant page keeps that theme and the
look stays on Fluvy's dashboards, as with "only dashboards". The panel says so, and offers the Fluvy theme through the
profile's own theme picker; it never changes anyone's theme by itself.
