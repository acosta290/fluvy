# The cards

Sixty-one cards, listed as **Fluvy · …** in the card picker, each with a live preview and an editor form. The form is
the reference for a card's options: it shows what the card does by default, and a default you leave as it is is never
written into the configuration. It shows an option only where it acts — in the style chosen, with the card's other
options as they are — and an option it hides keeps its value for when it acts again. In YAML, a card is
`type: custom:<tag>` plus the entity or entities it draws and any option the editor offers; the *Options* column below
names them (a select's values in brackets, a list with its item keys), and *Reads* the older names a card still
accepts (read, never written back). Every entity card also takes
`entity`, `name`, `icon`, `tap_action`, `hold_action`, `tone`, `color` and `card_color` (a quiet wash of a colour as
the card's own surface, its edge and dividers in it — see [the theme guide](theme.md#a-colour-per-card-and-per-item));
a list card takes `title`. A card with a head also takes `show_icon`: `auto` (the default: the circle gives way where
a long name in a narrow column needs its room, and only then), `always` (the circle stays while the name keeps a
few letters beside it: a smaller circle first, then none) or `never`. An `icon` left out — a card's, a row's or a
tile's — is the one you set for the entity in Home Assistant (in its settings, or a helper's, a scene's or a script's
own), else Fluvy's glyph for its kind, drawn open or shut as it stands (a door, a gate, a garage, a window), else its
integration's or Home Assistant's own: a sensor of a class Fluvy has no glyph for takes Home Assistant's, one of no
class keeps Fluvy's trend arrow unless its integration has an icon for it. The tables are generated from the code
(`pnpm docs:cards`).

Every card holds from the floor of a narrow column — 152 px for a card that takes half a section, 211 px for a full
one — up to a wall's 520 px, in light and dark, in every language Fluvy speaks; `unavailable`, `unknown` and a
missing entity are drawn on purpose (a quiet surface, inert controls, a dash for the value), never as an error, and
at the size and in the anatomy the card has live, so a grid never jumps when a device goes offline. Names may be
shortened with an ellipsis; values never are. A card that takes an action changes on screen first and calls
the service after; sliders and dials send on release, not per frame. A card of a list with nothing in it (a filter
that matches nothing yet, the last entry taken out) shows its head and an empty panel in its own words, never an
error: `empty_text` says what nothing means there ("All closed"), and `hide_empty: true` lets the card step aside
until something is listed again (see [auto-entities](troubleshooting.md#a-list-filled-by-auto-entities)).

`tap_action` and `hold_action` are Home Assistant's actions: `more-info` (the default), `toggle`, `navigate`, `url`,
`perform-action` (and `call-service`, as it was written before Home Assistant 2024.8), `assist`, `fire-dom-event`
and `none`. The head is the card's button: a tap on its circle, its name, the line under it or the room up to what
trails them answers the tap, and a still press anywhere on it the hold (with a keyboard: Tab to it, Enter taps,
Shift+F10 or the menu key holds). A control in the head (a switch, a "…" button) keeps its own tap beside it, and the
body keeps its own controls, so a slide is never a tap; a mouse that drags never taps either. A tile answers both on
its whole surface, a large one around its switch and ruler; a player on its art and its words; a greeting with no
avatar on its words. A head whose actions have nothing to act on (a card of many entities has no details of its own)
is no button at all. An action with a `confirmation` is asked about first, by Home Assistant's own dialog, and nothing
on the card moves before the answer.

## Customisation

Every card exposes what to show (section switches such as `show_fan`), which items appear and in which order (subset
lists such as `modes: [off, heat, cool]`), and at least one other layout through `variant`. Chip rows fill the row by
default and are content-sized on request (`preset_style`, `fan_style`, `suction_style: chips`). Cards that list rows
(lock, alarm, camera, bars, stat tiles) take a `rows` list edited with Fluvy's own rows editor. While a device is off,
the thermostat and the fan can keep to the essentials (`when_off: essentials`) — the thermostat its head, value and
modes, the fan its switch and speed ruler — and presets, fan speeds, oscillation and direction come back the moment a
mode or the switch wakes it (the water heater and the humidifier only have modes, so nothing hides on them).

A sensor card's readouts are named by their measure when nothing is set ("Temperature", "Humidity"); `label` names
the card's own sensor, an entry's `name` names that entry, and each entry may take its own `color`:

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-sensor-card
entity: sensor.office_climate_temperature
label: Inside
entities:
  - entity: sensor.office_climate_humidity
    name: Humidity
    color: teal
```

A chart is drawn in the house's chart style (fluvy's settings → Charts: `classic` from the factory, the chart every
card drew before 1.11) unless the card names its own with `chart`: `classic`, `soft` (a soft copy under the line,
hairlines at the quarters, Fluvy's knob at the line's end), `glow`, `minimal` (a thin line ending in its dot), `step`
(each reading held across its slot, on a scale of its own range), and, for a sensor alone whose readings add up (a
meter, energy, power, rain, gas, water, a price — not a temperature, a humidity or a pressure), `bars` and `columns`:
the window in at most 24 bars, an hour each over a day, each what the meter gained there or the slot's mean. The fine keys change
one thing of the style and are offered only where the style draws it — `curve` (`smooth`, `straight`, `step`), `fill`
(`gradient`, `flat`, `none`), `line_width` (`thin`, `regular`, `bold`), `glow`, `show_points` (`none`, `end`, `all`),
`show_grid` (`x`, `y`, `both`, `none`), `show_axis`, `highlight` (`min`, `max`, `both`, `current`) — and `animate:
false` draws the chart still. A card's own key wins over the house's setting, which wins over the style's own default;
a key the card never writes is the house's. A tile's spark is `minimal` where the card's style is, else classic.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-sensor-card
entity: sensor.living_room_temperature
chart: soft
line_width: thin
```

Every card that draws a chart takes `chart` the same way, each offered only the styles it draws: the energy card,
the history bars and production (their styles are in [the energy cards](energy.md)), the distribution's stack and the
bars card `classic` or `soft` (each part a pill, its ink deepening along it). A gauge card's ring takes `gauge`:
`ticks` (its dial since 1.0), `dial` (the thermostat's dial, read) or `ring` (a ring lit to the value, Fluvy's knob at
its end) — the bar and the signed ring keep their one look; the humidity card's ruler `ticks` (its marker, the classic
one) or `ruler` (read lit to the value, Fluvy's knob on it). A gauge that names none draws the house's where it can,
else its classic. The History page draws its charts in the house's style; it has no setting of its own.

A gauge card's ring may also move with what its sensor reads, each offered only for the sensors it reads: `liquid` (a
percentage, a humidity: two slow waves, the reading in the larger of water and air), `thermo` (a temperature: a sky
over the ground — snow falling on a drift when it is cold, a mild sun and a drifting cloud, heat haze over dry ground,
a desert with its saguaros from 35 °C), `tank` (a volume or a level: bubbles while it fills, as fast as it fills),
`battery` (its charge as a level, the warning's under 40 % and the danger's under 20 %; bubbles and the bolt while it
charges), `pulse` (power: rings that beat faster with more of it), `air` (wind, or a ventilation's flow: streamlines as
fast as the wind) and `sun` (power or irradiance from the sun: rays that lengthen and turn with it). How fast a tank
fills or a battery charges is read off the card's last hour; a moving gauge the sensor does not read (a sky for a
power) draws the ticks. The humidity card's band takes `liquid` too, its level the reading under the figure. Each
takes the column's width and the dial's height, so the card keeps its size. `animate: false` — the card's, else the
house's motion in fluvy's settings — rests a moving gauge on its first frame, still a wave, its bubbles, rings and
snow gone, as a system that asks for less motion does.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-gauge-card
entity: sensor.terrace_temperature
gauge: thermo
```
A light that only switches on and off (its `supported_color_modes` is `onoff` alone) draws the light card as its
head alone — the circle, the name, the state line and the switch, 84 px — in every style, and its editor offers only
what the bulb does: no layout, stepper or live update, no temperature ruler, no quick colours.

A colour bulb's quick colours (`colors`) are the house's own, any number in any order: `warm`, `cool`, a Home
Assistant colour name, `#rrggbb`, `[r, g, b]`, `picker` (a round that opens the browser's colour picker), or any of
those with a `name` its round says. The editor edits them row by row — a colour (the words, the picker, or *Custom
colour* with a colour well) and a name — and shows the bulb's default six until the list is touched; a hex reads as
itself and a colour name as words ("Deep purple") when no name is given.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-light-card
entity: light.lamp
colors:
  - warm
  - color: "#ff2d55"
    name: Lila
  - color: [0, 128, 128]
    name: Teal
  - deep-purple
  - picker
```

A lit light card can show its light's colour on its whole surface (`tint`, 1.9): `on` while the light is on, `always`
with a quiet wash of it at rest too, `off` never. How much: `full` (the default) is a lit tile's fill in that colour —
the same on every palette as a tile's — `soft` a gentler wash, and `brightness` a wash as strong as the lamp is bright
(a lamp at 10 % still reads lit). The colour is the card's own `color` when it has one (*Primary* is the palette's
accent; the editor's *State* follows the light), else its `tone`, else the light's: the colour it glows, a group's lit
members' by their brightness, the one you just tapped. A white shows its warmth (1.10) on one scale, from Home
Assistant's own colour for its temperature: a candle's (2,200 K) the warmest, 2,700 K warm, 4,000 K a little, 5,000 K
nearly neutral, daylight (6,500 K) neutral, and a cool one, above it, cool — or the palette's lit light with
`light_whites: palette`. A light that only dims or only switches, and a white Home Assistant gives no colour for, have
no colour of their own and take the palette's lit light. Where a card says nothing of its surface, the house decides
(the settings panel → Appearance → Lights; off unless chosen):

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-light-card
entity: light.sofa_lamp
tint: on
tint_strength: brightness
```

Tiles, a tiles group, a room's tiles and rows, and an entities card's rows can wear a lit bulb's colour as well
(`light_colors: true`, or the house's choice; the room lights card does unless told not to), a white by its warmth
or as the palette's light as above (`light_whites`). Every light a card draws follows one rule (1.10): its own `color`,
else its own `tone`, else its bulb's colour, else the card's `color`, else the card's `tone`, else the palette's lit
light — so a bulb's colour now comes before the card's. A light group wears its lit members' colours, weighed by their
brightness. The editors offer only what acts: the whites while the bulbs show their colours, the colour at rest
(`tint`) on a room lights card in tiles and on a room with tiles, a light's colours on a tile of a light.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-lights-card
area: bedroom
variant: tiles
light_whites: palette
```

The history bars card reads a sensor's long-term statistics (`days` bars of a `period`: days, weeks or months; a
bar is what a meter gained, or a measurement's `mean`, `max` or `min`). Its head readouts (`head`) and the facts
under the chart (`facts`) are lists of kinds you compose in order — `total`, `average`, `highest`, `lowest`,
`today`, and the equivalents `co2` (× `co2_factor`, 0.4 kg a kWh), `trees` (22 kg a tree a year), `km` (5 km a
kWh), `money` (× `price`, in the house's currency), `share` (`of` another sensor) and `template` — each with its
own `name`, `icon`, `color`, `unit`, `decimals`, `factor` and `tap_action`. The factors are rough and yours to set.
Every part switches off (`show_values`, `show_axis`, `show_grid`, `show_dates`, `show_facts`, `show_head`), the
day in progress joins with `include_today`, and `variant: compact` keeps the bars and their dates, `mini` a row of
readouts and a sparkline:

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-history-bars-card
entity: sensor.grid_export_energy
name: Feed-in to grid
icon: up
color: '#86B98C'
price: 0.19
facts:
  - kind: share
    of: sensor.solar_energy
    name: Share of production
    icon: tower
  - kind: money
    name: Revenue (est.)
  - kind: co2
    name: CO₂ avoided
```

By default a meter's bars are what Home Assistant counts (its long-term `change`, the Energy dashboard's numbers).
A counter that starts again from zero on a cycle — a day counter, a monthly rain gauge — is better read by its own
readings: `reset: day` (or `week`, `month`, `year`) reads it at each hour's or day's end, so a reset that comes as
two writes, a restart that reads 0 for a moment, or a `total` without `last_reset` is never counted twice or below
zero; `reset: never` reads a lifetime meter the same way. The editor names a utility meter's own cycle. `stat: state`
draws the reading at the end of each bar (a monthly gauge by month is each month's rain). A sensor with no state
class has no statistics: its bars come from the recorder's history, kept for its last days (`source: history` asks
for it always). Today is live, the average, the highest and the lowest are the finished bars', and the days before
a sensor existed stay empty. `negative_color` and `current_color` give the bars below zero and the one in progress
colours of their own; `unit` converts within energy, power, volume and distance:

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-history-bars-card
entity: sensor.rain_this_month
days: 28
include_today: true
reset: month
unit: in
current_color: blue
```

## Templates in row text

In every list of rows (entities, lock, alarm, camera, bars, stat tiles, actions, helpers) a row's `secondary` may be
a Home Assistant template instead of a keyword or words of its own: anything with `{{ … }}` or `{% … %}` is rendered
by Home Assistant and kept live, so the line changes as the entities it reads do. The row's own entity is `entity` in
the template and the person looking at the dashboard `user`; a template that fails renders an empty line, never its
own text. The editor's field takes a keyword or a template alike. A camera's rows are its history: each says when it
last changed, as the time of day, unless its `secondary` asks for another line (`state`, `area`, an attribute, a
template, `none`), and a row's `tone` or `color` shows on its circle. A row with no `tap_action` of its own opens its
entity's details.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-entities-card
rows:
  - entity: climate.living
    secondary: "{{ state_attr('climate.living', 'current_temperature') }} °C · {{ states('sensor.humidity') }} %"
```

A row's time — the openings card's "2 h ago", a list row's *last change* line, a tile's, a person's — is Home
Assistant's `last_changed`, which a restart or a reload resets. Where the house keeps the real one (1.11: a
timestamp sensor such as `sensor.front_door_real_last_changed`, or an attribute of the entity's own), the row reads
it from there with `since`: the sensor's id, or `attribute:<name>`, as an ISO date or an epoch in seconds or
milliseconds; the editor offers the house's timestamp sensors, and takes any other typed. The openings card names one
for every row at once with `since_pattern` — `sensor.{id}_real_last_changed`, `{id}` the row's object id, `{entity}`
its whole id — and a row's own `since` wins. A sensor that is empty, unknown, unavailable or no moment at all leaves
the row on Home Assistant's own time.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-openings-card
since_pattern: sensor.{id}_real_last_changed
rows:
  - binary_sensor.front_door
  - entity: binary_sensor.garage_door
    since: attribute:last_opened
```

## Template

The template card is a tile — compact (the default), mini or large, the tile card's own — whose `name`,
`secondary`, `icon`, `color` and `active` may each be a Home Assistant template, rendered and kept live as a row's
text is. `entity` is optional. With one, the tile is that entity's: its glyph, its tone and its state, on a large tile
its switch, its ruler and its `readouts`, and a template reads it as `entity`. Without one, the tile is your words
alone: it wears the resting skin, toggles nothing, and is a button only for an action that needs no entity
(`navigate`, `url`, `perform-action`, `assist`).

- `secondary`: `state` (the default with an entity), `area`, `last-changed`, `none` (the default without one), words
  of your own or a template. Your own words that do not fit lose their last ` · ` parts, then end in an ellipsis.
- `icon`: an icon such as `mdi:lightbulb`, or a Fluvy glyph's name (`bulb`).
- `color`: a colour (a Home Assistant colour's name, `#rrggbb`, `rgb(…)`) or one of the palette's tones (`warning`,
  `heat`, `water`…); `tint: always` keeps it at rest. The editor's colour picker takes a colour; a template goes in
  YAML.
- `active`: when the tile shows as on — `auto` (as its entity is; the default), `always`, `never`, or a template: on
  unless it gives `off`, `false`, `no`, `0` or another state that reads as off. The fill is `active`'s; a large
  tile's switch and ruler still say what the entity is.

Until Home Assistant answers, the tile shows its entity's own glyph, colour and state, and a blank line where the
words will land, so nothing moves when they do; a template that fails shows nothing of itself, and a reader hears
the entity's name (or "Template").

A Mushroom template card pastes in: `primary` is read as `name`, `icon_color` as `color`, `layout: vertical` (or
Mushroom's later `vertical: true`) as the mini tile (`horizontal` and `default` as the compact one). `fill_container`,
`multiline_secondary`, `double_tap_action` and `entity_id` have no part here and are let go when the editor saves;
`picture`, `badge_icon` and `badge_color` stay in the configuration, not drawn. One difference to know: Mushroom's
template card does nothing on a tap or a hold unless you give it an action, where Fluvy's tile toggles what toggles (a
light, a switch) on a tap and opens its details on a hold. To keep a pasted card still, write
`tap_action: { action: none }` (and `hold_action: { action: none }`).

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-template-card # was custom:mushroom-template-card
entity: sensor.washer_power
primary: "{{ 'Washing' if states(entity) | float > 10 else 'Washer' }}"
secondary: "{{ states(entity) | round }} W"
icon: mdi:washing-machine
icon_color: "{{ 'blue' if states(entity) | float > 10 else 'grey' }}"
active: "{{ states(entity) | float > 10 }}" # Fluvy's own: the fill
layout: vertical
```

## Schedules

The automations card lists every automation of the house — on or off, when it last ran — and the schedules Fluvy
wrote among them with their days, their times and their next run. A schedule is a native Home Assistant automation
(it is in Settings → Automations too, and Home Assistant's own editor opens it); Fluvy only adds the easy sheet, the
list and the management. Tap `+` to add one: what it targets, what it does (on, off, open, close, run; a
brightness or a target temperature), on which days (every day, workdays by the workday integration's sensor, the
weekend, or the days you pick), when (a time, or sunrise and sunset with an offset) and, with an end, until when.
One edited in Home Assistant past Fluvy's shape is still listed, as a plain row; only administrators add, edit or
delete, and everyone else sees the list, the switch and Home Assistant's dialog on tap.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-automations-card
show: schedules
variant: tiles
entities:
  - automation.good_morning
  - automation.blinds
```

A card in a popup is about one lamp, not the house: `targets` lists the entities it is about (each with a name, an
icon and what a new schedule for it does — its verb, a brightness, a temperature), the list shows their schedules and
the automations Home Assistant relates to them, the head says when the lamp next turns on, and `+` opens the sheet
already set to it, so a timer is `+`, pick the time, Save. The sheet's "Until" has quick ends (15 min, 30 min, 1 h,
2 h after the start). Only administrators create or edit automations (Home Assistant's rule); everyone else gets the
list and the switches.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-automations-card
title: Timers
targets:
  - entity: light.kitchen
```

## Appliances

The appliance card finds a washer, a dryer, a dishwasher, an oven, a hob, a hood, a fridge, a freezer, a wine cooler, a
coffee machine, a kettle, an air fryer, a microwave, a toaster, a blender, a sandwich maker — or any appliance on a
smart plug, read from the plug's switch and power — by what its integration says (LG ThinQ and LG's older SmartThinQ,
Home Connect, Miele, SmartThings, Matter, Whirlpool, Tuya, hOn, Electrolux) or by its name in any of Fluvy's
languages; `kind` names it when the card guesses wrong, `roles` names an entity for a role. The card is the design a
reader drew for us: a picture of the appliance (`picture`: a drawing a kind, the icon, none, or `image` for your own
photo), its name and what it is doing, a power button tinted by what it does, its kind's hero — the time left over a
bar, an oven's temperature and target, a fridge's compartments, a hob's zones, a coffee machine's drinks — and three
`rows` under a hairline (the programme, water, energy, a filter to clean, the last coffee: picked, ordered, named,
coloured and given actions in the rows editor), `maintenance` as rows of their own, and buttons only where the
integration's own code says exactly how (start, pause, stop, power, the light; the rest is shown and never written).
`variant: compact`, `ring` (a dial) and `row` are the smaller layouts; every part switches off (`show_power`,
`show_hero`, `show_progress`, `show_rows`, `show_controls`…). An administrator sees a bell beside the time left:
"Tell me when it's done" writes a normal automation that notifies their phone when the appliance finishes.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-appliance-card
device: 1f2c…            # the appliance's device; or entity: one of its entities
kind: washer             # auto by default
rows: [program, water, energy]
```

The appliances card lists the house's appliances (or those it names in `appliances`) as rows, compact rows, tiles
or — `variant: cards` — each as its whole card side by side, as many as fit: what needs a hand first, then what runs,
what waits, what is done, what rests; `show: active` keeps only the busy ones. The automatic dashboards lay the
house's appliances out the same way across Home and across every room.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-appliances-card
variant: cards
```

## Cameras

The cameras card shows several cameras at a glance, as a reader drew it (#60): each a tile of its picture — "Live" at
its top and a full-screen round at its bottom — over its circle (its own `icon`, the one set for the camera, its area's,
the camera), its name and its line. The line reads the camera's motion sensor where it has one (`motion`, else the
motion, occupancy or presence sensor on the camera's device): "Motion detected" (its circle neutral, or in the camera's
own `tone` or `color` where it has one) or "No motion"; else the camera's state ("Online", "Recording", "Streaming",
"Offline"); `status` asks for one of them, or `none`. The cameras are those it lists in `cameras`, else every camera of
its `area`. Each picture refreshes itself only while it is on screen (`refresh`, in seconds), or streams with
`camera_view: live` — the first `max_live` of them (four by default), the others keeping to stills. A picture whose
stream cannot play shows its stills and says so on its line ("Stream unavailable"). `columns` lays the tiles out
(`auto`: one in a narrow column, two from 320, up to four across a wide band); `variant: list` is a row a camera with
its thumbnail, `compact` the pictures alone with their names. The head's round opens a sheet of every camera, with a
switch that shows them all live, or none, while the dashboard stays open (never written to the card; none with
`max_live: 0`); a `hold_action` on the card runs there instead.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-cameras-card
title: Outside
cameras:
  - entity: camera.driveway
    icon: mdi:fence
  - entity: camera.garden
    motion: binary_sensor.garden_person
  - camera.terrace
  - camera.garage
columns: 2
camera_view: live
max_live: 2
```

## Items

The items card lists the items of a sensor's list attribute (#66) — the aircraft a FlightRadar24 sensor keeps in
`flights`, a departures board, parcels on their way — a row each (60), a compact row (48, the name and the value) or a
tile (76, two a row from a 320 column), under a head that counts them from the sensor's state. `attribute` names the
list (`auto`, the default, takes the first attribute that holds one — `flights`, `items`, `entries` or `list` first);
`items_template` is a template that gives the list instead (as JSON), so any sensor becomes one. Each item is shown by
the fields the configuration maps — `item_name`, `item_secondary`, `item_value`, `item_unit`, `item_icon`,
`item_image` and `item_url`: a field of the item (`altitude`, `airport.city`, `legs.0.from`) or words with `{field}`
in them, `{a|b}` taking b where a is empty; a number is written in your locale with its digits, a date and time as a
moment, and a " · " segment that says nothing goes — or by a preset that knows the integration's shape. `preset: auto`
(the default) draws flights where the attribute is `flights` or the items carry a `callsign` or a `flight_number`: the
callsign over the route (`AMS → BCN`) and the aircraft, the altitude in feet with a climbing or descending arrow (from
`vertical_speed`, ±100 ft/min) or "On ground", the aircraft's photo as its circle, the nearest first — and hides the
`item_*` fields; `none` keeps your mapping, `flights` asks for the preset. The figures keep the integration's units —
feet, knots, feet a minute, kilometres — as the FlightRadar24 integration reports them. `sort` orders the list by a
field (`sort_order`: `ascending` or `descending`; numbers as numbers, words as the language sorts them, items without
the field last). `max_rows` (1–20, five) is the card's height, never the list's length: fewer items, the empty panel
and a sensor out of reach keep the size. `show_count` puts the count under the title ("3 aircraft"; `subtitle` wins),
`show_image` an item's picture in its circle (one that will not load falls back to the glyph). A tap on an item opens
its sheet — the flight's airline, route, aircraft, altitude, speeds, heading, distance, position and times, with a
round to the flight on flightradar24.com; a plain item's every field — or nothing (`item_tap: none`); the head's tap
opens the sensor's details.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-items-card
entity: sensor.flightradar24_current_in_area # the count as its state, the aircraft in `flights`
title: Flights nearby
max_rows: 5
empty_text: Clear skies
```

A list of your own, mapped field by field:

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-items-card

## Alerts

The alerts card gathers what needs a look. Each alert is one line — a `preset` (`low_battery`, `unavailable`, `open`,
`unlocked`, `hazards`, `errors`, `updates`, `lights_on`, `ha_alerts`, `repairs`) or a matcher of your own (ids,
`entity_id` patterns, `domain`, `device_class`, `integration`, `area`, `floor`, `label`, `device`, `state`, `above`,
`below`, `attribute`, `for`…) — and one definition drives its count, its list in the sheet and its buttons. A preset
waits where a moment is no news — `unavailable` and `open` five minutes, `unlocked` ten — and `for` says otherwise
(`for: 0` shows it at once). Alerts are ordered by `severity` (critical, warning, info; info in the palette's accent,
or its blue where the accent is warm enough to pass for a warning), an alert can `escalate` after a while or past a
count, and `conditions` take Home Assistant's own visibility shapes. `variant` draws them as `tiles` (the default),
`mini`, `chips`, `rows` under a head, or a `banner` that turns through them; the card hides itself while all is clear
(`hide_empty: false` keeps an "All clear" tile). A tap opens the alert's sheet — each entity with its state, where
and how long, a button of its own (Lock, Close, Install, Dock, Acknowledge) and the alert's (Lock all, asked first) —
and Snooze (an hour, eight, until tomorrow morning, until it changes; the snooze follows you to every device, or
stays on this device with `snooze: device`); a long press opens every alert, the snoozed ones with Wake. Home
Assistant's repairs (for administrators) and its `alert` entities are alerts too.

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-alerts-card
alerts:
  - preset: unavailable
    domain: light
    name: Lights unavailable
  - preset: low_battery
  - preset: open
    for: { minutes: 15 }
  - preset: errors
  - preset: updates
```

## Web page

The web page card frames a page — a lightning map, a chart of your own, a site — on a plate: under a head with the
page's host on its line (`variant: plate`, the default; `title`, `subtitle` and `icon` are yours to set), alone on the
card (`frame`) or with no card at all (`bare`). The plate keeps the shape asked for (`aspect_ratio`: `16:9` by default,
`4:3`, `3:2`, `1:1`, `2:1`, `21:9`, Home Assistant's `56%`, or `fill` for the view's height in a panel or grid view)
or the `height` written (in px, which wins); `scale` draws the page smaller (a dense map at `0.75` shows more of
itself) and `refresh` asks for it again every so many minutes while the tab is shown and the card on screen. Its rounds
sit at the plate's bottom end — open in a new tab, full screen (the plate itself; a phone that cannot opens the tab)
and reload (`show_open`, `show_fullscreen`, `show_reload`) — and a narrow plate gives them up in order, the reload
first. `look: dark` inverts the page where the page cannot be asked for a dark one — pictures invert too — and
`auto` does so only while the card is dark. A skeleton covers the plate until the page loads; one still loading after
twenty seconds says so and offers the tab. A page that refuses to be framed (its `X-Frame-Options` or its frame
ancestors) loads all the same, blank: no card can tell from outside, and the open round is the way out.

The page is framed as Home Assistant's own iframe card frames it: `sandbox: standard` (the default) is Home
Assistant's set — forms, pop-ups, pointer lock, its own origin, scripts, modals, downloads — and
`allow_open_top_navigation` lets a tap in the page send this tab elsewhere; `strict` keeps the page from its cookies
and storage (no `allow-same-origin`), its pop-ups, modals and downloads; `off` lifts every limit, which only a page of
your own deserves. The frame sends no referrer and takes `allow: fullscreen` as its permissions policy (`allow` names
another). On an https dashboard an http page is never asked for — the browser would refuse it without a word — so the
plate says the page needs https, at its size, its open round alive. Home Assistant's `type: iframe` card pastes in:
`hide_background` is the bare plate, `disable_sandbox` the level `off`.

## Chart

The chart card draws any time series (#68) — a sensor's history, its long-term statistics, a list in its attributes or
a weather's forecast — from what has happened to what is to come, now marked and what is to come dashed. `series`
lists them, six at most: an entity, or the entity with what it says of itself — `source` (`history`, `statistics`,
`attribute` or `forecast`; by default a weather's forecast, the list its attributes hold where it holds one of the
usual ones, else its history), `attribute` (the list; one that says today reads its tomorrow after it, as Nordpool's
`raw_today` and `raw_tomorrow`), `time_key` and `value_key` where the list's keys are not the usual ones (`start`,
`from`, `time`, `period_start`, `datetime` …; `value`, `price`, `pv_estimate`, `temperature` …), `stat` and `period`
for statistics (a meter's change and a measurement's mean by default; an hour a reading through a week, a day beyond),
`name`, `tone` or `color`, `unit` and `decimals` (a unit its sensor's converts to scales its figures; any other names
the unit its list is written in — Solcast's kW under a kWh sensor), `curve`, `fill` and `kind`: `line`, `area`,
`columns` (drawn under the lines, on one scale) or `band` (its lows and highs). The lists read are Nordpool's (24 hours
or 96 quarters a day, and its plain `today` and `tomorrow`), Tibber's map of hours to prices, ENTSO-E's and Frank
Energie's prices, Solcast's forecast (its tenth and ninetieth percentiles a band), and any list of entries with a
moment and a value, a map of moments to values, or a day's values; quarters stay quarters and a negative price stays
negative. `span` is the window: `24h` (the default) or any `<N>h` or `<N>d` rolling to now, `today`, or
`today+tomorrow`, which is today alone until tomorrow's prices are published.

`thresholds` colour the line from a value up to the next threshold, each in a tone — `ok` is the good, cheap one: the
line changes colour where it crosses one, and a bar takes the tone of the threshold its value reaches. `highlight`
marks the cheapest and the dearest window of what is to come (`min`, `max` or `both`; a price's in the ok and the
danger tones, any other series' in its own) as a stretch of the plot behind the line and a pill that names it —
"Cheapest 13:00–15:00 · 0.078 EUR/kWh", shorter where the row is narrow — over `highlight_hours` (one by default);
the `step` style marks both unless told otherwise. `show_head` writes the value now big over the chart with its change
on the period before ("+5 %": a rolling window against as long a stretch before it, a calendar day against the day
before; from history or statistics), and `show_legend` names two or three series in the value row, four or more under
the axis. The chart is drawn in the house's chart style or the card's own (`chart`, and every fine key of the sensor's
chart above); a pointer, a held finger or the keys (← → a slot, Home, End, Escape) read it, and the value row reads
with it. `variant`: `full` (the head, the value row, the chart and its axis), `compact` (the head, the chart, its
axis) or `tile` (the value over a spark of every series). Its height is its variant's and its series count's —
loading, empty or out of reach it keeps it — and where the value row has nothing to say, the chart takes its room.

## A minimal card

```yaml
type: custom:fluvy-tile-card
entity: light.living_room_lamp
```

Open the editor on it to see every option the tile offers — size, readouts, the tap action — with its default.

## Where they are used

The [automatic dashboard](automatic-dashboard.md) puts every one of these cards to use in a house that has one of
everything; its tests hold that promise. The [design language](../design/language.md) is what each card is built and
reviewed against.
