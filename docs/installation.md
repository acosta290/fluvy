# Installation

Fluvy is one integration. Installing it through HACS puts everything in place: the module every page loads, the
settings panel, the dashboard resource and the theme. Nothing is written to `configuration.yaml`.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant **2026.9.0** or newer.
- [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) (or the release zip, below).
- The themes folder included in `configuration.yaml`. Most installations already have these lines; if not, add
  them (the theme is a file Home Assistant reads from `themes/`):

  ```yaml
  frontend:
    themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
  ```

## Through HACS

1. HACS → menu (⋮) → **Custom repositories** → add `https://github.com/acosta290/fluvy`, type **Integration**.
   The button in the README opens this dialog with the fields filled in.
2. Search for **Fluvy** and download it.
3. Restart Home Assistant (HACS asks for it).
4. **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration** → search for **Fluvy** → add. There is nothing to configure.
5. Reload the browser, then choose the **Fluvy** theme in your profile (**Theme → Fluvy**) or accept the offer in
   the panel's *Scope* tab. Everyone in the house does this once, on any device; it follows their profile.

## From the release zip

Download `fluvy.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/acosta290/fluvy/releases/latest), unzip it so that
the files land in `<config>/custom_components/fluvy/` (the zip holds the folder's content: `manifest.json` sits
directly inside `fluvy/`), restart Home Assistant and continue at step 4 above.

## What the integration does

Every start, the integration:

- serves the build it ships under a URL named after the build, `/fluvy-frontend/<version>-<build>/…`, cacheable for a
  month because a new build is a new URL;
- loads the module on every page (Home Assistant's `extra_module_url`, set from code — no YAML);
- registers the settings panel (`/fluvy`, **Fluvy** in the sidebar, for everyone, not only administrators);
- keeps one dashboard resource pointing at the current build, so dashboards load the cards before they render;
- installs the theme into `<config>/themes/fluvy/fluvy.yaml` (only when it changed) and reloads the themes.

It stores nothing but its config entry. Fluvy's own settings live in Home Assistant's frontend data (see
[the settings panel](settings-panel.md)).

## Repairs

When something only you can do is needed, it appears in **Settings → System → Repairs**:

| Issue | What it means | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| *Fluvy's theme is not loaded* | the theme file is in place but `configuration.yaml` does not include the themes folder | add the two lines from *Requirements*, then run the action `frontend.reload_themes` (Developer tools → Actions). No restart needed; the issue clears itself. |
| *Add Fluvy's dashboard resource* | your dashboard resources are configured in YAML (`lovelace: resources:`), which Fluvy cannot write | add the resource the issue shows (`type: module`) and reload the browser. Fluvy already loads on every page; the resource lets dashboards load it before they render. |
| *Remove Fluvy's old lines from configuration.yaml* | a manual install from before the integration left `panel_custom:` and `extra_module_url` entries pointing at `/local/fluvy/` | delete the lines the issue lists, keep the `themes:` line, check the configuration and restart when convenient. The integration has already taken over. |

## Updating

HACS shows the new version like any other; download, restart. The new build gets a new URL, so no browser or
service worker ever serves an old build. The theme is rewritten only when it changed.

## Uninstalling

**Settings → Devices & services → Fluvy → Delete.** The integration removes the panel, the module, the dashboard
resource and the theme file. Then remove Fluvy in HACS and restart. Dashboards you built with Fluvy cards keep their
configuration; the cards show as missing until Fluvy is back.
