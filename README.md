<p align="center"><b>Try it: <a href="https://acosta290.github.io/fluvy/">acosta290.github.io/fluvy</a></b> — the real cards, pages and settings panel on a simulated home, in your browser.</p>

<p align="center">

</p>

Fluvy brings one design to the whole of Home Assistant: a theme, sixty-two cards, five automatic dashboards, a
settings panel, the Activity and History pages, and Home Assistant's own pages restyled to match — all from one
set of design tokens, installed as one integration through HACS. Every card is drawn on a 4 px grid, checked
by an alignment measurer, and holds from a phone to a wall tablet, in light and dark, in ten languages.

## The whole app, one design

The sidebar, the header, the tabs, the dialogs, the settings pages: with the Fluvy theme on, Home Assistant
looks like it was designed with the cards, because it was — the same tokens, the same type (Inter), the same
radii and hairlines. On a wide screen the app floats in a rounded frame inside the window (or fills it: a setting).
A dashboard's view tabs are yours to style: the views as words with the accent under the open one (as here), as
pills, as icons, Home Assistant's own, or none at all.

## Sixty-two cards

Every card has an editor form and a live preview in the card picker; every option is documented in
[the cards](docs/cards.md). Sliders and dials are precision controls: relative drag, slide away to slow down,
hold for the 1 % scale.

<p align="center">

</p>

**Control** — lights with brightness and colour temperature, a room's lights on one card (one tap for the whole
room, a round for each light, in its bulb's colour), thermostats (dial or compact), water heaters and humidifiers,
covers with position and tilt, fans, vacuums, valves, media players and TVs, 3D printers (OctoPrint, PrusaLink,
Bambu Lab, Moonraker, Creality, Elegoo, Anycubic, Snapmaker and FlashForge: the job, its time left, the heaters, the
filament unit's trays, the camera, pause and stop), tiles and lists — and a tile of your own whose name, line, icon
and colour are Home Assistant templates (the Template card; a Mushroom template card pastes in).

</p>

**Energy** — the energy flow, read the way your meters are: one sensor, import and export apart, or each phase — so
a house that imports and exports at once shows both, every lane in the colour of where its energy came from, with
the Energy dashboard's own sources when you give it none. Beside it: the balance of what comes in and goes out, the
grid by phase, batteries, a car charger, where a day's energy went (a sankey), the score, water and gas, the house's
power by source, the whole house on one chart with its batteries' charge (a power scale and gridlines on both), solar
by array, consumption by device, gauges for anything, and a sensor's last days, weeks or months as bars from its
long-term statistics — a counter read by its own readings when Home Assistant's sum is not the truth, today live.
An Energy period strip is the Energy dashboard's date picker: the energy cards that follow it — Fluvy's and Home
Assistant's — move together to a day, a week, a month or a year, with Home Assistant's own figures, and the Energy
usage card draws them as its usage graph, a column an hour, a day or a month. Every figure in the unit and the
decimals you ask for. [How they read a house](docs/energy.md).

</p>

**Security and sensors** — locks, alarms, cameras (live, in their own shape, or several at a glance on the Cameras
card, each with what it sees), openings and motion, humidity, plants, gauges, sensor tiles, and up to three sensors on
one chart.

<p align="center">

</p>

**Charts** — every chart and gauge drawn by one engine, in a style the house chooses once (`classic`, the chart
Fluvy always drew, or `soft`, `glow`, `minimal`, `step`, `bars`, `columns`, `band`) or a card chooses for itself; a
gauge read as Fluvy's own dial, ring or ruler, or moving with what it reads — a liquid, the sky over the ground, a
tank, a battery, a pulse, the air, the sun. The Chart card draws any time series from what has happened to what is to
come — a sensor's history, tomorrow's electricity prices, a solar forecast — with thresholds in their colours and the
cheapest hours marked.

</p>

**Home, time and helpers** — weather and forecasts, who is home, scenes and actions, calendars (month, week,
timeline, upcoming), clocks (analog, digital, world), readouts and trends, safety, helpers, updates, timers, to-do
lists, and the house's automations: every one as a row with its switch and last run, and schedules written in a
sheet as native Home Assistant automations — for the whole house, or for the one lamp a popup is about. A web page on
a plate (a map, a site of your own), and the items of a sensor's list as rows — the flights overhead, a departures
board — each with a sheet of its details.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://acosta290.github.io/fluvy/?sheet=web&amp;palette=linen"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acosta290/fluvy/main/docs/images/readme/web.webp" width="411" alt="The Web page card: a map of lightning strikes on a plate under its head, with open and full screen"></a><a href="https://acosta290.github.io/fluvy/?sheet=items&amp;palette=linen"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acosta290/fluvy/main/docs/images/readme/items.webp" width="411" alt="The Items card: the flights overhead as tiles"></a>
</p>

**Appliances and alerts** — a washer, a dryer, a dishwasher, an oven, a hob, a fridge, a coffee machine or a kettle
on a plug, read from LG ThinQ, Home Connect, Miele, SmartThings, Matter, Whirlpool, Tuya, hOn and Electrolux, or
from a smart plug's power: a picture of the appliance, what it is doing, the time left over a bar, three rows for
its programme, water, energy or the filter to clean, the reminders, "Tell me when it's done" — the design a reader
drew for us (#47) — and the house's appliances in one list or as whole cards side by side. An alerts card gathers
what needs a look — low batteries, devices gone, doors left open, leaks and smoke, updates, repairs — each alert one
line, as tiles, chips, rows or a banner, hidden while all is clear, with a snooze that follows you to every device.

</p>

## Activity and History

Two of Home Assistant's pages, drawn in the same idiom: the logbook as a timeline with who did what, and the
history as charts with a scrub cursor, grouped by room or device. They stand in for the built-in pages while
the house wants them; a switch gives Home Assistant's pages back.

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://acosta290.github.io/fluvy/?activity=1&amp;palette=linen"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acosta290/fluvy/main/docs/images/readme/activity.webp" width="411" alt="The Activity page: the day's logbook as a timeline, who did what, with the hours beside it"></a><a href="https://acosta290.github.io/fluvy/?history=1&amp;palette=linen"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/acosta290/fluvy/main/docs/media/history-scrub.gif" width="411" alt="The History page: one cursor scrubbed across a chart reads every chart at the same moment"></a>
</p>

## The settings panel

**Fluvy** in the sidebar: fifteen palettes in a pastel and an electric line, or your own accent with every
contrast checked; three shapes; how every chart and gauge is drawn, with the series' colours; where the look
applies; the automatic dashboard; and each person's own preferences — language, motion, haptics, a palette of their
own. Changes apply live on every device, no reload.

</p>

## The automatic dashboards

One line — `strategy: { type: custom:fluvy-home }` — and Fluvy reads your areas, devices, entities and energy
preferences and builds Home, Rooms, Lights, Climate, Energy, Security, Media, Agenda and Sensors: what needs
attention first (hidden while all is clear), lights grouped by room, a card a room that opens the room's own page,
the large appliances as whole cards side by side and the small ones as rows, the running thermostat first,
the home's forecast, the whole Energy dashboard read (every grid connection, the battery's charge, water and gas),
batteries and phones told apart. Four more templates build
a dashboard each — **Rooms** (a tab a floor), **Energy**, **Security** and a **Wall** for a tablet — and the panel
creates any of them with one tap. Every one is rebuilt every time it opens, so a new device simply shows up.
[How they read a home](docs/automatic-dashboard.md).

## What you get

- **One theme, light and dark**, generated from the same tokens the cards are drawn with.
- **Sixty-two cards** with editor forms, picker previews, and `unavailable`, `unknown` and missing states
  drawn on purpose, at the size and in the anatomy the card has live — among them a Template card for tiles of your
  own (Home Assistant templates, a Mushroom template card pasted in), a Cameras card for every camera at a glance and
  a Chart card for any time series, from a sensor's history to tomorrow's prices.
- **Charts in a style of the house's**: classic, soft, glow, minimal, step, bars, columns or band, chosen once in the
  settings panel or per card, and gauges that move with what they read.
- **Energy as your meters read it**: a house that imports and exports at once shows both, per phase; with nothing
  configured the cards read the Energy dashboard, and a day, a week or a month add up to its own figures — or
  follow its date picker, beside Home Assistant's own cards.
- **Five automatic dashboards** built from your registries: the home, the rooms, the energy, the security, a wall.
- **Wall mode** for a tablet: no sidebar, no header, a screensaver with the clock, dark at night, the screen kept
  awake — `?kiosk` on the dashboard's address and the tablet remembers, a × in the corner is the way out.
- **A settings panel** for the house and for each person.
- **Activity and History pages** in the same idiom.
- **Everywhere**: Home Assistant's own pages in the same design while it wears the Fluvy theme — and left as Home
  Assistant draws them while it wears another.
- **Ten languages** — English, Spanish, German, Dutch, French, Italian, Brazilian and European Portuguese, Turkish
  and Japanese — in every card, page and dialog, each fetched only when spoken.
- **No telemetry, no network calls of its own**, no dependency but Lit, pinned to Home Assistant's version.

## Installation

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=acosta290&repository=fluvy&category=integration)

Fluvy needs Home Assistant 2026.9 or newer, HACS, and one line most installations already have in
`configuration.yaml` — the theme is a file in your `themes` folder, and this is how Home Assistant reads it:

```yaml
frontend:
  themes: !include_dir_merge_named themes
```

1. Search for **Fluvy** in HACS and download it — or click the button above, which opens it in your HACS. Fluvy
   is in HACS's default store (and in Home Assistant's Marketplace from 2026.11, which reads the same catalogue)
   under **Integration**, not Theme: a HACS theme can only be a YAML file, and Fluvy is the theme plus the cards,
   the dashboards, the settings panel and the restyling of Home Assistant's own pages, which only an integration
   can install. Search for "Fluvy" or "theme" with no type filter.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to **Settings → Devices & services → Add integration**, search for **Fluvy** and add it. There is nothing to
   configure: the integration puts the settings panel in the sidebar, loads Fluvy on every page and installs the
   theme.
4. Reload the browser, then choose the **Fluvy** theme: in your profile (**Theme → Fluvy**), or from the panel's
   *Scope* tab, which offers it.

Without HACS: download `fluvy.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/acosta290/fluvy/releases/latest),
unzip it into `<config>/custom_components/fluvy/`, restart, and continue at step 3.

If something is missing — the theme line above, a resource that has to be added by hand because your dashboards
are configured in YAML, an old manual install — Home Assistant tells you in **Settings → System → Repairs**, with
exactly what to add or remove.

## First steps

Open **Fluvy** in the sidebar.

- **Appearance** — the palette, the shape and the buttons, for the house; each person can keep their own.
- **Charts** — the style every chart is drawn in, the gauge, the series' colours and motion, for the house.
- **Scope** — where the look applies: your dashboards only, or everywhere in Home Assistant; whether the frame,
  the icons and the pages are Fluvy's.
- **Dashboards** — create any of the five automatic dashboards with one tap and set its options, or add a
  dashboard of your own with `strategy: { type: custom:fluvy-home }` (or `fluvy-rooms`, `fluvy-energy`,
  `fluvy-security`, `fluvy-wall`) in its raw configuration.
- **Wall** — what this tablet is, which dashboards are walls, the screensaver, day and night, the background.
- **Preferences** — language, motion and haptics, per person.

The cards are in the card picker under **Fluvy · …**, each with a preview; `docs/cards.md` lists them with their
options.

## Compatibility

Home Assistant **2026.9** or newer. The theme, the shell and the pages are checked against each Home Assistant
release; a release can change a page the shell restyles, and `docs/shell.md` says what happens then. Fluvy runs in
every current browser and in the Companion apps. Lit is bundled, pinned to the version Home Assistant ships; there
is no other runtime dependency, and Fluvy makes no network requests of its own.
