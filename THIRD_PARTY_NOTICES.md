# Third-party notices

Fluvy is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (see `LICENSE`). It is built with, and its release
ships, work by others under the licences below, all of them compatible with the GPL. Nothing else reaches a Home Assistant instance: the
release is the integration folder — Fluvy's own Python and JavaScript, Lit, and the Inter font.

## Shipped in the release

### Lit 3.3.3 — BSD-3-Clause

`lit`, `lit-html` 3.3.3, `lit-element` 4.2.2 and `@lit/reactive-element` 2.1.2 are bundled into `fluvy.js`
(pinned to the version Home Assistant's frontend uses). https://lit.dev

### Inter — SIL Open Font License 1.1

The variable font by The Inter Project Authors (https://github.com/rsms/inter), shipped as a Latin + Latin
Extended subset (`inter-variable.woff2`, `inter-italic-variable.woff2`) beside its licence, `OFL-Inter.txt`. No
Reserved Font Name is declared, so the subset keeps the family name. The font may be used and redistributed under
the OFL, but not sold on its own.

-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,

not met.

## Used at build time only (not in the release)

- **Home Assistant frontend** — Apache License 2.0, © the Home Assistant contributors. The type declarations of
  `hass` and the cards' contract are transcribed into `packages/core/src/ha/`, and the list of the frontend's CSS
  variable names (`packages/theme/src/__tests__/ha-vars.json`) is generated from its sources so the theme's tests can
  check that every name it writes exists. https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend
- **Material Design Icons** (`@mdi/js` 7.4.47) — Apache License 2.0, © Pictogrammers. Only 32-bit keys derived
  from the icon paths are kept (`packages/core/src/icons/mdi.ts`), so the shell can tell which Material icon Home
  Assistant is drawing and swap it for Fluvy's own glyph; no icon artwork is redistributed.

- **culori** 4.0.2 — MIT, © Dan Burzo. The OKLCH maths behind the palettes; only the derived hex values reach the
  theme and the bundle. https://github.com/Evercoder/culori
- Development tooling (Vite, Rollup, terser, TypeScript, Vitest, happy-dom, tsx, ESLint, Prettier, Playwright,
  resvg, ruff) under MIT, Apache-2.0 and MPL-2.0 licences, listed with their licence texts in `node_modules` after
  `pnpm install`.
