# Third-party notices

Fluvy is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 (see `LICENSE`). It is built with, and its release
ships, work by others under the licences below, all of them compatible with the GPL. Nothing else reaches a Home Assistant instance: the
release is the integration folder — Fluvy's own Python and JavaScript, Lit, and the Inter font.

## Shipped in the release

### Lit 3.3.3 — BSD-3-Clause

`lit`, `lit-html` 3.3.3, `lit-element` 4.2.2 and `@lit/reactive-element` 2.1.2 are bundled into `fluvy.js`
(pinned to the version Home Assistant's frontend uses). https://lit.dev

### Inter — SIL Open Font License 1.1

The variable font by The Inter Project Authors (https://github.com/rsms/inter), shipped as a Latin + Latin
Extended subset (`inter-variable.woff2`, `inter-italic-variable.woff2`) beside its licence, `OFL-Inter.txt`. No
Reserved Font Name is declared, so the subset keeps the family name. The font may be used and redistributed under
the OFL, but not sold on its own.

This Font Software is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1.

-----------------------------------------------------------
SIL OPEN FONT LICENSE Version 1.1 - 26 February 2007
-----------------------------------------------------------

PREAMBLE
The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
with others.

The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded, 
redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

DEFINITIONS
"Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
Holder(s) under this license and clearly marked as such. This may
include source files, build scripts and documentation.

"Reserved Font Name" refers to any names specified as such after the
copyright statement(s).

"Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components as
distributed by the Copyright Holder(s).

"Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to a
new environment.

"Author" refers to any designer, engineer, programmer, technical
writer or other person who contributed to the Font Software.

2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,

contains the above copyright notice and this license. These can be
included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.

3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font
Name(s) unless explicit written permission is granted by the corresponding
Copyright Holder. This restriction only applies to the primary font name as
presented to the users.

4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font
Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any

5) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole,
must be distributed entirely under this license, and must not be

### Simple Icons 16.37.0 — CC0 1.0 Universal

The marks of the streaming platforms the TV remote card draws (`chunks/app-logos-*.js`, fetched only by a remote card
that shows an app) are taken from Simple Icons, release 16.37.0 (https://simpleicons.org, https://github.com/simple-icons/simple-icons),
each one's path copied as it is and scaled to sit with Fluvy's glyphs: netflix, movistar (for Movistar Plus+), appletv,
rakuten (for Rakuten TV), youtube, youtubemusic, youtubetv, youtubekids, hbomax, max, paramountplus, dazn, crunchyroll,
tubi, twitch, plex, jellyfin, emby, kodi, spotify, applemusic, applepodcasts, deezer, tidal, steam, playstation, mubi,
vimeo, dailymotion, soundcloud, audible, pocketcasts, viaplay, googletv, googleplay, channel4, itvx, zdf, starz,
showtime, now, nebula, fubo, tiktok, roku, bilibili; the brand colours beside them are the release's data. Simple Icons
is released under CC0 1.0 Universal (https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/): the set's authors waive
their copyright, and no attribution is required; this notice is given for the record.

The logos themselves are the trademarks of their owners, shown only to identify each service on the person's own
television; Fluvy is not affiliated with or endorsed by any of them. Disney+, Prime Video, Peacock, Filmin,
SkyShowtime, Pluto TV, Amazon Music, ATRESplayer, RTVE Play and Mitele have no mark in an open set: Fluvy draws its own
two-letter monogram for them, no likeness of theirs.

### Material Design Icons 7.4.47 — Pictogrammers Free License (Apache License 2.0)

Three marks of the same chunk come from Material Design Icons 7.4.47 by the Pictogrammers (https://pictogrammers.com/library/mdi/,
`@mdi/js`): `mdiHulu` (Hulu), `mdiMicrosoftXbox` (Xbox) and `mdiNintendoSwitch` (Nintendo Switch), each one's path
copied as it is and scaled to the glyphs. The Pictogrammers Free License redistributes its icons under the Apache
License, Version 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0): the paths are used under that licence, as is,
without changes of substance.

```
Pictogrammers Free License
--------------------------

This icon collection is released as free, open source, and GPL friendly by
the Pictogrammers icon group. You may use it for commercial projects, open
source projects, or anything really.

Icons: Apache 2.0 (https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0)
Some of the icons are redistributed under the Apache 2.0 license. All other
icons are either redistributed under their respective licenses or are
distributed under the Apache 2.0 license.

## Used at build time only (not in the release)

- **Home Assistant frontend** — Apache License 2.0, © the Home Assistant contributors. The type declarations of
  `hass` and the cards' contract are transcribed into `packages/core/src/ha/`, and the list of the frontend's CSS
  variable names (`packages/theme/src/__tests__/ha-vars.json`) is generated from its sources so the theme's tests can
  check that every name it writes exists. https://github.com/home-assistant/frontend
- **Material Design Icons** (`@mdi/js` 7.4.47) — Apache License 2.0, © Pictogrammers. Only 32-bit keys derived
  from the icon paths are kept (`packages/core/src/icons/mdi.ts`), so the shell can tell which Material icon Home
  Assistant is drawing and swap it for Fluvy's own glyph; no icon artwork is redistributed.
  https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign-JS
- **culori** 4.0.2 — MIT, © Dan Burzo. The OKLCH maths behind the palettes; only the derived hex values reach the
  theme and the bundle. https://github.com/Evercoder/culori
- **SortableJS** 1.15.6 — MIT, © the SortableJS contributors. The library behind Home Assistant's own `ha-sortable`:
  the playground stands that element in with it, so a row dragged there is dragged as it is at home. Home Assistant
  brings its own; nothing of it reaches the release. https://github.com/SortableJS/Sortable
- Development tooling (Vite, Rollup, terser, TypeScript, Vitest, happy-dom, tsx, ESLint, Prettier, Playwright,
  resvg, ruff) under MIT, Apache-2.0 and MPL-2.0 licences, listed with their licence texts in `node_modules` after
  `pnpm install`.

"Home Assistant" is a trademark of the Open Home Foundation; Fluvy is an independent project that works with Home
Assistant and is not affiliated with or endorsed by it.
