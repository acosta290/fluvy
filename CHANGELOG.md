# Changelog

All notable changes to Fluvy are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] — 2026-09-27

### Changed

- The README shows the whole product: the app with the sidebar and tabs, three galleries of cards, the two
  pages, the four tabs of the settings panel.


## [1.0.1] — 2026-09-27

### Changed

- The HACS listing says what Fluvy is: "Fluvy - Premium Theme & Cards", so a search for a theme finds it.
- The README renders inside HACS as well: absolute image URLs, no `<picture>` element.
- The licence badge is static, so it never depends on a cache.

### Removed

- The files prepared for Home Assistant's brands repository, which no longer takes custom integrations; the
  integration serves its own icon.


## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-27

The first public release.

### Added

- The Fluvy theme: one generated theme, light and dark, written from the same tokens the cards use.
- Thirty-nine cards for lights, climate, energy, media, security, calendar, clocks, helpers, people, weather and
  more, each with an editor form and a picker preview.
- The automatic dashboard (`strategy: { type: custom:fluvy-home }`): Home, Lights, Climate, Energy, Media and
  Sensors built from the registries and the energy preferences.
- The settings panel in the sidebar: sixteen palettes in a pastel and an electric line or a custom accent, three
  shapes, where the look applies, per-person preferences, applied live.
- The Activity and History pages, replacing Home Assistant's logbook and history pages while the house wants them.
- The shell: Home Assistant's own pages (Settings, dialogs, forms, the sidebar) in the same design while the
  Fluvy theme is worn.
- The integration (`custom_components/fluvy`): installs through HACS, serves the build, loads it on every page,
  registers the panel and the Lovelace resource, installs the theme, and says through Repairs what only you can do.
- English and Spanish.
