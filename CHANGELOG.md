# Changelog

All notable changes to Fluvy are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] — 2026-09-27

### Added

- Swipe between a dashboard's views on a phone: the view follows the finger, and letting go past a third of the
  width (or a flick) opens the next tab, which slides in from the finger's side. A drag that begins on a ruler, a
  dial, a slider, a scrolling row of chips or a map is theirs; a drag that leans vertical stays a scroll; the
  screen's edges are left to the system. Each person's to turn off in Preferences → *Swipe between views*.
- German, Dutch, French, Italian and Brazilian Portuguese, for every card, page and the settings panel, chosen in
  Preferences or taken from Home Assistant's language. One catalogue per language, fetched only when spoken; the
  automatic dashboard reads a house named in any of them.

## [1.1.2] — 2026-09-27

### Added

- Tiles card: each tile's readouts are chosen in the editor (a plug's power, its energy today, its cost); a wide
  tile shows three, a narrower one two. A sensor whose device class is monetary is labelled Cost.
- Light card: half a section is enough. Under 260 px of content (or `variant: compact`) the card keeps its head,
  with the level in the state line, and the brightness ruler alone, so two lamps share a line; the layout editor
  lets it go down to six columns (it stopped at nine).

## [1.1.1] — 2026-09-27

### Changed

- The demo opens in the light mode on Blaze, and lays its frames out in lanes filled by height: nothing overlaps,
  nothing is left hanging.

### Fixed

- Settings: the first card sits 16 px under the toolbar on a desktop too (it touched it).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-09-27

### Added

- A public demo at https://acosta290.github.io/fluvy/: the real cards, pages and settings panel on the simulated
  home, with the palette, mode, device and language changed live; deployed by `pages.yml` on every push to `main`.
- Motion clips in the README: the precision dimmer, the energy flow changing pace, a palette applied in the settings
  panel, a scrub across the History charts. `pnpm clips` records them on the playground (`tools/render/clip.mjs`)
  with the gestures the interaction suites prove.
- The settings panel's Dashboard tab lists Fluvy auto in Home Assistant's sidebar, or takes its entry out (an
  administrator's switch).

### Changed

- Activity: the icons sit 4 px clear of the timeline's spine, as the dots already did.
- The interaction suites and the clips share one gestures module (`tools/render/lib/gestures.mjs`).

### Fixed

- The documentation counts fifteen palettes (there was never a Cobalt), lists the automatic dashboard's options as
  the code has them (`dial | compact | ruler`, `ribbons | rail | legs`, eight views) and no longer mentions an
  Activity card that does not exist; CI measures the two devices sheets by their names.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-09-27

### Changed

- The README shows the whole product: the app with the sidebar and tabs, three galleries of cards, the two
  pages, the four tabs of the settings panel.


## [1.0.1] — 2026-09-27

### Changed

- The HACS listing says what Fluvy is: "Fluvy - Premium Theme & Cards", so a search for a theme finds it.
- The README renders inside HACS as well: absolute image URLs, no `<picture>` element.
- The licence badge is static, so it never depends on a cache.

### Removed

- The files prepared for Home Assistant's brands repository, which no longer takes custom integrations; the
  integration serves its own icon.


## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-27

The first public release.

### Added

- The Fluvy theme: one generated theme, light and dark, written from the same tokens the cards use.
- Thirty-nine cards for lights, climate, energy, media, security, calendar, clocks, helpers, people, weather and
  more, each with an editor form and a picker preview.
- The automatic dashboard (`strategy: { type: custom:fluvy-home }`): Home, Lights, Climate, Energy, Media and
  Sensors built from the registries and the energy preferences.
- The settings panel in the sidebar: sixteen palettes in a pastel and an electric line or a custom accent, three
  shapes, where the look applies, per-person preferences, applied live.
- The Activity and History pages, replacing Home Assistant's logbook and history pages while the house wants them.
- The shell: Home Assistant's own pages (Settings, dialogs, forms, the sidebar) in the same design while the
  Fluvy theme is worn.
- The integration (`custom_components/fluvy`): installs through HACS, serves the build, loads it on every page,
  registers the panel and the Lovelace resource, installs the theme, and says through Repairs what only you can do.
- English and Spanish.
