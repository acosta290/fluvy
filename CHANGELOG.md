## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.0] — 2026-09-27

The first public release.

### Added

- The Fluvy theme: one generated theme, light and dark, written from the same tokens the cards use.
- Thirty-nine cards for lights, climate, energy, media, security, calendar, clocks, helpers, people, weather and
  more, each with an editor form and a picker preview.
- The automatic dashboard (`strategy: { type: custom:fluvy-home }`): Home, Lights, Climate, Energy, Media and
  Sensors built from the registries and the energy preferences.
- The settings panel in the sidebar: sixteen palettes in a pastel and an electric line or a custom accent, three
  shapes, where the look applies, per-person preferences, applied live.
- The Activity and History pages, replacing Home Assistant's logbook and history pages while the house wants them.
- The shell: Home Assistant's own pages (Settings, dialogs, forms, the sidebar) in the same design while the
  Fluvy theme is worn.
- The integration (`custom_components/fluvy`): installs through HACS, serves the build, loads it on every page,
  registers the panel and the Lovelace resource, installs the theme, and says through Repairs what only you can do.
- English and Spanish.
